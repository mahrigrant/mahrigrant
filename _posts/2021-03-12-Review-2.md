## _*Summary_* ##

The Stainforth Library of Women’s Writing showcases the personal library of Francis John Stainforth. This library includes the work of more than eight thousand Anglophone women who, for the most part, have not been included in literary history. This library features a large variety of work, including dramatists, artists, poets, composers, and many other forms of writing. Overall, this website aims to digitize the unknown works of these women in order to provide a platform that they were not allowed to have when they were alive.

When exploring this website, you have the option to click on the tabs: “Home” “Book Hunt”, “The Catalog”, “Writing On”, “Teaching”, “About”, and “Contact”. The website utilizes a combination of pictures, interactive maps, informative paragraphs, and links to portray the information that it has to offer.  Each page is clear and easy to understand and the website is simple to navigate overall. The interactive book is easy to use, and it allows you to click through the pages. The map feature is helpful and easy to navigate, and when you click on a location, the book icon lights up and a pop-up box appears letting you know where a Stainforth book is located.

## *_Relevance_*

IMAGE-CLASSROOM
This website is extremely relevant because it gives a platform to unknown creations by women. In doing this, it highlights the importance of women’s literature, and it may inspire similar websites that aim to showcase the work of women as well. The map feature helps people with the ability to locate copies of the books near the, so that they have a way to further their knowledge and curiosity about the subject. There are also eight pages of articles under the “Writing On” tab, and that is very useful because it lets the reader know what updates have been made to the website recently. This is a good feature for people who want to continue to visit the website for more information after their initial exploration. The “Teaching On”tab  also is a very relevant and useful resource because it links several different lesson plans that teachers can use in their classrooms, in order to teach their students about lost works by women.

## *Findings_* ##

While exploring this website, I found that it was easy to explore and it did not have any confusing elements. One thing that I noticed is that the website color palette is mostly black and white, and it could benefit from having more color in it, to draw attention and make it more aesthetically pleasing. I liked that each section in the book catalog was organized by alphabetical order, and that there was a link to look at explanations of symbols and abbreviations. I also thought it was a good feature to link the TEI as well. Overall, this project was extremely useful for discovering hidden works and I really enjoyed the experience of exploring it.
