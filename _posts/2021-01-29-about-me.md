####**About Me**    
          My name is Mahri Grant and I am a senior at Christopher Newport University, where I am majoring in English. My hometown is Smithfield, Virginia and I am originally from Plymouth, Michigan, and I have also lived in both South Carolina, and Nashville, TN. My personal interests include watching T.V. shows (my **_favorites_** being _Charmed_, _Inuyasha_, and _Dragon Ball Z_) as well as reading Y.A. novels [_Shiver_](https://maggiestiefvater.com/novels/the-shiver-trilogy/) by Maggie Stiefvater is my personal favorite) and painting in my spare time. 
          I am interested in this Digital Humanities course because I believe that it will aid me in my future career of being a teacher. In the ever changing world, technology has become integral to everyone's lives in so many ways, and especially in the lives of the younger generation. I believe that the Digital Humanities will help me to connect with my future students, as well as assist me in showing them fun and educational uses of technology. In order to do this, I want to learn more about Digital Humanities myself, so that I am able to utilize it for the benefit of my students. 
          In order to accomplish my goal of being a teacher, I will begin my Masters in the Arts of Teaching, at CNU as well, in June. During the student teaching portion of my experience I hope that I can practice using Digital Humanities in my lessons, so that the students are able to experience something new at school. Currently, in the lab Education, Culture and Society, I have the opportunity to observe and interact with students, and I will likely use the lessons I am learning in this Digital Humanities course as I learn them in order to see how the students respond. I am also participating in a 120 hour Observation Internship at a local elementary school currently, and I am happy that I will be able to share insight into Digital Humanities and how it can apply to education with the teacher that I am working with.
          Overall, I believe that Digital Humanities will help open my eyes to all the ways I can engage with digital resources, and I hope that one day I will be able to create and contribute to the field of Digital Humanities as well.
