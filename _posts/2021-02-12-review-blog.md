## _*Summary*_ ##
_Digital Aponte_ is a website that aims to show the work of José Antonio Aponte, a free man of color. The website shows the history of Aponte’s creative works, as well as his treatment by the Spanish. The website also highlights his lost “book of paintings” and the things that inspired him. Each tab included in the website explores Aponte’s artistic journey and allows the audience to interact and learn more about him and his vision. 

## _*Design*_ ##

The design of the website is very aesthetically pleasing and includes cursive writing that says “Digital Aponte” on top of an image of a painting. Under this, there are tabs that say ‘Home”, “Jose Antonio Aponte”, “Book of Paintings”, “Image Gallery”, “Aponte’s Library”, “Aponte’s Library”, “Aponte’s Havana”, “Visionary Aponte Exhibit” and “Bibliography”. On the front page, there is also a “Welcome and Site Contents” section that summarizes the life of Aponte and the features of the website. The website was strengthened by its continuity, because even though each tab showed something different, they all flowed together with similar design features. This creates a clean design that does not feel jumbled with contrasting design elements. 

## _*Relevance*_ ##
The website does a great job of including history, interactive links and maps, and pictures in each of the tabs. It shows the importance of Aponte, and the website layout and information shows that immense research that went into creating the website. The image of books shown on the “Aponte’s Library” tab allows the user to hover over them, and actually click on each one. This is a nice feature because it is both interactive and educational at the same time. These books provide even more information about Aponte and show that he is a figure in history that historians are extremely curious about.

In the acknowledgements section, the Polonsky Foundation-NYU Digital Humanities Internship Program, NYU’s FAS Office of Educational Technology, and Digital Scholarship Services at Bobst Library are thanked for their support. Jennifer Vinopal, Zachary Coble, Andrew Battista, and Armanda Lewis are listed as well for being supporters of the Aponte project.

## _*Findings*_ ##
Overall this project is a great way to learn about people in history that are not typically talked about. It shows an extensive effort to showcase information about Aponte, and the website design is very modern and interesting to interact with. One minor aspect that I would suggest needs to be modified is the “Book of Paintings” tab. When you hover over this tab a drop down window appears with two options: “Book of Paintings” or “Láminas”. If the user of the website is not Spanish speaking, they might not know that Láminas means “pages”. I would suggest that the word “pages” be put in parenthesis so that both English and Spanish speakers find it accessible. Another small modification I would suggest would be to modify the map on the “Aponte’s Havana” tab. When the user hovers over the blue and green points on the map, the name of each location appears, but I think it would be more interactive if more information about each place was listed, along with why it was important to Aponte’s Book of Paintings. The site does say that it plans to add more information to the map in the future, so I look forward to this update. I would recommend this project for others to read because it is very well done and educational, and it clearly has potential to be a popular website where people visit to learn more about lesser known history.
