## *Picking a Topic* ##

I came up with the idea for my project while looking for a project to review for our second review blog in class. I wanted to do a project that was geared towards children or children's books, but I struggled to find any. This surprised me because kids are using technology now more than ever, and having digital humanities projects that can be used in schools would be really helpful. From there, I decided that if I could not find any projects for children, I would create one myself.

## *Environmental Scan* ##

Once I started doing the Environmental Scan, which was the first step of my project, I realized that there really were not any projects that were like mine, as far as I could tell. My project was focused on creating a website where children can discover Virginia childrenâ€™s book authors, take a book aptitude test, and find local libraries that may carry the books that they want. I also decided to include one digitized book for the children to be able to click through. I found several websites that had each aspect, but none that had them all together into one, like my project would be. These other websites were not digital humanities projects, so I am happy that my project would theoretically be adding something new to the world of Digital Humanities.

## *Grant Narrative and Design* ## 

I really wanted to sell my project in the Grant Narrative. I emphasized the need for projects like mine, and all of the design features and technology that would be included. It was really important for me to find a really good mapping tool to use for my website, so that my project would look like something that is worthy of being sponsored. I quickly learned that  it was harder than I thought, and that a majority of them were not what I was looking for, and the others were extremely expensive and out of the realm of possibility for me. Once I found Caliper Maptitude I was happy to find a map creator that was less than half off my budget, and had all of the features I needed. I also really wanted to add a lot of color and design features that would capture the attention of users, so in my Grant Narrative, I wrote about wanting to use Canva, which is a great website for designing and adding special touches. Lastly, the quiz maker tool called Typeform was really useful, and had a lot of special effects to it that make it really fun for a children's website, and their free version was more than enough for what I needed.

## *Budget* ##

In order to stay on budget, I had to rely on a lot of free versions of websites. A lot of research went into finding ones that were not only free, but actually good quality and worthwhile. At certain points I got frustrated, but I soon began to stumble upon websites that were free and more than what I thought I would be able to get at that range. My advice for anyone creating a Digital Humanities project would be to persevere and really look around, because there is always something out there that will work for you in your budget, you just have to find it.

## *Resume* ##

Before talking about resumes in class, I thought mine was perfectly fine. I was wrong. It needs a lot of work, and it is a lot harder to fix it than what I thought. Yesterday, I found a new template that I really liked and thought it was going to be really easy to fix it. I was wrong again. It was hard to fit everything into one page, and into the sections that the template had. I am currently starting at the drawing board and will keep trying to fix it until it is perfect. I am glad that I realized this now, because I am applying for jobs soon, and it is important to have my resume perfect not only for this project, but for my future employers who will look at it extensively.

## *Final Thoughts and Takeaways* ## 

This project inspired me to create something that kids would love. I have learned how important Digital Humanities is from this project, and from this class in general. I have also learned a lot about different technology software and design websites that I can use to help me in the future as a teacher, and I am really excited and grateful for that as well. Overall, this project has been really fun to complete, and I am glad that I was able to explore my creative side more in this class, and develop a digital presence that will aid me in the future.
